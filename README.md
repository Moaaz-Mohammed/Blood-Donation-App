# Blood Donation Application

This application is for charity and educationally purposes only.
It's developed by me to help people who need blood donors and connect to them easily.


## What I used in it :
- Firebase : I Used Google's firebase to manage authentication using email and password, also for store data in firestore .
- Bloc: I Used Bloc State Management.

## This app supports
- Multi-language (Ar - En).
- Light and Dark Moods.
